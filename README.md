Project Brief:
 
For this project, I was tasked with creating a healthcare app that allows patients to share
health metrics with doctors and receive timely advice. 

My Approach:
 
With a strong focus on ensuring the app meets the needs of different haemophilia patients, I designed the interface elements with usability as a top priority. My approach involved carefully considering how to communicate key information through both text and visuals, making it as clear and intuitive as possible for all users. To achieve this, I drew inspiration from existing healthcare app layouts while incorporating my own unique design elements to enhance accessibility and user experience.  

Color Scheme:
I chose a colour scheme featuring purple (pun intended!) and ocean blue to create a calm and empathetic aesthetic as patients navigate the app’s menu sections. This ensures that the app remains visually appealing, even when dealing with sensitive topics like haemophilia and personal health conditions. By carefully selecting this colour palette, I aimed to balance aesthetic appeal and intuitive user experience, making the interface both welcoming and easy to use.  Git Repo: https://github.com/MaccccD/HexSoftwares_DesigningHealthcareApp_DumiMofolo.git
